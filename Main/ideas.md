1. Motion controller car
2. Blackjack machine

3. Blackjack machine
4. Chatgpt chat bot
5. Door/light opener
6. Maze solver
7. Path following
8. Math solver
9. Motion controller (tilt sensor)

# Plan:

1. Build arm.
   - Sensors in a square pattern to sense tilt in x/y direction.
   - Arduino board connected to bluetooth to send info about tilt.
2. Build car.
   - Arduino board connected to bluetooth to receive info about tilt.
   - Coordinate front wheels with tilt.
3. Make bluetooth connect to each other.
